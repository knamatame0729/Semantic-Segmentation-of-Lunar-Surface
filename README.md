# ORBSLAM3 Semantic Mapping for RAS598 Final Project at Arizona State University
## Overveiw
**This repository is for a project in RAS 598 calss at Arizona State University**
- Midterm Project  
I implemented a semantic segmentation by using an encoder-decoder neural network based on the U-Net architecture with VGG16 as the encoder. This model was specifically developed for rover-based lunar terrain segmentation.

- Final Project  
I integrated semantic segmentation with ORB-SLAM3 to address the limitations of both semantic segmentation and the 3D point cloud generated by ORB-SLAM3.

## Introduction
**ORBSLAM_Semantic_Mapping** is based on [ros2_orb_slam3](https://github.com/Mechazo11/ros2_orb_slam3). ORB SLAM3 is a great SLAM method that has been applied robot application. However, this method can not provide semantic information in environmental mapping. In this project, I present a method to build a 3D semantic map, which utilize both 2D semantic images from semantic segmentation model (U-Net with a VGG16 as encoder) and 3D ponit cloud map from ORB SLAM3.

## Challenge and Future Plan
- [ ] The U-Net architecture with VGG16 as the encoder is relatively slow, producing 2D
semantic images at only 4 FPS. This issue can be addressed by replacing the
encoder with a more efficient backbone, such as EfficientNet or MobileNet.
- [ ] The generated point cloud contains some noise. This can be addressed by applying
filtering techniques to each ray. For example, sampling points along each ray and
removing outliers could result in a cleaner and more accurate 3D point cloud.
- [ ] In this approach, I assign class labels to 3D points based on the semantic
segmentation of each frame and visualize the resulting semantic point cloud in
RViz2. However, this semantic point cloud is not updated when loop closure occurs
in ORB-SLAM, and therefore it does not reflect the pose corrections resulting from
loop closure.
